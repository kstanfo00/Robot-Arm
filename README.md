## Hello_CircuitPython

### Planning



### Description & Code
This assignment was our intro assignment to circuitpython. Our job was to get the neopixel to blink and change colors. 



```python
import board
import neopixel
import time 

dot = neopixel.NeoPixel(board.NEOPIXEL, 1)
dot.brightness = 0.5 
while True:
    dot.fill((0, 0, 255))
    time.sleep(0.5)
    dot.fill((255, 255, 255))
    time.sleep(0.5)
```


### Evidence







### Wiring


### Reflection
This assignment took longer than needed, because of the initial importing of functions into cirucuit python. I also had trouble using the serial monitor as well.
